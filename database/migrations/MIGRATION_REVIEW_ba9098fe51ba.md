# Migration Review: ba9098fe51ba_experimental_description_property

## Summary
The auto-generated migration contained **multiple critical SQLite incompatibilities** and has been corrected to be an empty (pass-through) migration.

## Why This Migration Should Be Empty

The "experimental description property" feature is implemented **entirely in Python** as a `@property` on the `Experiment` model. It requires **NO database schema changes** because:

1. It uses the existing `experiment_notes` table
2. It uses the existing `notes` relationship on the Experiment model
3. The first note (ordered by `created_at`) serves as the description
4. No new columns, tables, or constraints are needed

## Critical Issues Found in Auto-Generated Migration

### Issue 1: ALTER COLUMN for Enum Type Changes ❌

**Lines 24-31, 41-44 of original migration**

```python
# ❌ FAILS on SQLite - ALTER COLUMN not supported
op.alter_column('chemical_additives', 'unit', 
    existing_type=sa.VARCHAR(length=10),
    type_=sa.Enum('GRAM', 'MILLIGRAM', ...),
    existing_nullable=False)

op.alter_column('compounds', 'preferred_unit',
    existing_type=sa.VARCHAR(length=10),
    type_=sa.Enum('GRAM', 'MILLIGRAM', ...),
    existing_nullable=True)

op.alter_column('experiments', 'status',
    existing_type=sa.VARCHAR(length=11),
    type_=sa.Enum('ONGOING', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED'),
    existing_nullable=True)
```

**Problem:**
- SQLite does NOT support `ALTER COLUMN` for type changes
- Enum conversions require batch mode (table recreation)
- These changes are unrelated to the description property

**Solution:** Removed - not needed for this feature

---

### Issue 2: ALTER COLUMN for Nullability Changes ❌

**Lines 32-40 of original migration**

```python
# ❌ FAILS on SQLite - ALTER COLUMN not supported
op.alter_column('elemental_analysis', 'sample_id',
    existing_type=sa.VARCHAR(),
    nullable=False)

op.alter_column('elemental_analysis', 'analyte_id',
    existing_type=sa.INTEGER(),
    nullable=False)

op.alter_column('experimental_results', 'time_post_reaction',
    existing_type=sa.FLOAT(),
    nullable=True)
```

**Problem:**
- SQLite does NOT support `ALTER COLUMN` for nullability changes
- Would require batch mode (table recreation)
- These changes are unrelated to the description property
- `time_post_reaction` nullable change was already handled in migration `2a832c8d5048`

**Solution:** Removed - not needed for this feature

---

### Issue 3: Self-Referential Foreign Key ❌

**Line 45 of original migration**

```python
# ❌ FAILS with CircularDependencyError
op.create_foreign_key(None, 'experiments', 'experiments', 
    ['parent_experiment_fk'], ['id'], ondelete='SET NULL')
```

**Problem:**
- Self-referential FK causes `CircularDependencyError` in SQLite batch mode
- SQLAlchemy's topological sort cannot resolve the circular dependency
- The FK constraint was already intentionally skipped in the lineage migration (`54e7b847aa92`)
- The relationship is properly defined in the model without a DB-level constraint

**Solution:** Removed - intentionally not added per SQLite compatibility rules

---

### Issue 4: Unnamed Constraint ❌

**Lines 45, 52 of original migration**

```python
# ❌ BAD - Cannot drop unnamed constraints later
op.create_foreign_key(None, 'experiments', ...)  # None = no name
op.drop_constraint(None, 'experiments', ...)     # Cannot find it!
```

**Problem:**
- Using `None` for constraint name makes it impossible to drop later
- Alembic cannot find the constraint by name in downgrade

**Solution:** Removed (constraint not needed anyway)

---

### Issue 5: Unrelated Changes ❌

**All changes in original migration**

**Problem:**
- Migration named "experimental_description_property"
- Contains changes to `chemical_additives`, `compounds`, `elemental_analysis`, `experimental_results`, `experiments`
- None of these changes are related to the description property feature
- These are leftover changes Alembic detected from other model modifications

**Solution:** All removed - keep migrations focused on one feature

---

## Corrected Migration

The migration has been corrected to be a pass-through (empty) migration:

```python
def upgrade() -> None:
    """No schema changes needed for description property."""
    pass

def downgrade() -> None:
    """No changes to revert."""
    pass
```

## Verification

To verify the migration is safe to run:

```bash
# Check current migration state
alembic current

# Run the migration (safe - it does nothing)
alembic upgrade head

# Test rollback (safe - it does nothing)
alembic downgrade -1

# Upgrade again (idempotent)
alembic upgrade head
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Always review auto-generated migrations** - Alembic often includes unrelated changes
2. **Description property needs no schema changes** - It's pure Python using existing relationships
3. **SQLite has strict limitations** - No ALTER COLUMN, no self-referential FKs in batch mode
4. **Remove unrelated changes** - Keep migrations focused and clean
5. **Name all constraints** - Never use `None` for constraint names
