# Deployment Workflow

## Development Environment (Personal Work Computer)
- Primary development and code changes happen here
- Changes are committed and pushed to GitHub
- Local database is used for development and testing
- Environment variables should be configured for local development

## Production Environment (Lab PC)
- Acts as the production server hosting the Streamlit app
- Pulls changes from GitHub to update the application
- Maintains the production database
- Runs automated backups and public database copies
- Environment variables should be configured for production

## Database Management
- Lab PC maintains the production database (experiments.db)
- Personal computer uses a separate development database
- Never directly modify the production database on the lab PC
- All database changes must go through migrations

## Backup Strategy
- Lab PC runs automated backups every 48 hours
- Public database copies are created every 12 hours
- Backup location is configured via BACKUP_DIRECTORY environment variable
- Public copy location is configured via PUBLIC_DATABASE environment variable

## Deployment Process
1. Make changes on personal work computer
2. Test changes locally
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Pull changes on lab PC
5. Run any new migrations
6. Restart the Streamlit app if necessary

## Environment Variables
- Keep sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Use different .env files for development and production
- Never commit .env files to GitHub
- Document required environment variables in README.md

## Important Notes
- Always pull latest changes before starting new development
- Test database migrations locally before deploying
- Keep backup and public copy locations synchronized between environments
- Monitor backup logs for any issues
- I am using cursor from my personal PC, command line tool requests can not be run on Lab PC. Write them out for me to run in Git Bash on Lab PC.
